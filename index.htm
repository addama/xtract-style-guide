				<h1><a id='use-of-color' class='anchor' href='#use-of-color' title='Link to this section'>#</a>Use of Color</h1>
				
				<h3>Keep Colors Professional</h3>
				<p>Keep your use of color to a minimum, using it to distinguish important elements, separate similar elements, or assert brand identity. The majority of your documents, sites, etc, should be white, black and/or dark gray.</p>
				<p>Above all, do not let your use of color (or lack thereof) hinder readability. At the end of the day, our products and documents have to be functional as well as aesthetic.</p>
								
				<h3>Flat Is Timeless</h3>
				<p>Avoid patterns or backgrounds whenever possible, except in solely decorative areas. Prefer flat, solid color backgrounds using neutral colors, preferrably white.</p>
				
				<h3>Use Common Sense</h3>
				<figure>
					<img class='heroImage' src='./images/bootstrap_buttons.png' alt='Bootstrap buttons example image' title='Bootstrap buttons example' />
					<figcaption>Example of Bootstrap colors</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Use obvious colors to signal status to the user. Red is bad, and signifies errors, dangerous actions, and warnings. Green is good, and signifies acceptance, default actions, and good decisions. Yellow signifies caution, and alternative actions; meanwhile, Blue is an alternative to Green if more than one acceptable action is present. Use Gray to present actions and messages that the user needs or can do, but they aren't important or common.</p>
				<p>If you have access to a style library in code (e.g. Bootstrap), use its default color scheme for buttons, as it will likely follow these rules without you having to determine your own color palette.</p>
				
				<h3>Brand Colors</h3>
				<p>Use only <em>Xtract Blue</em> and <em>Xtract Yellow</em> and neutral colors in company letters, correspondence, manuals, and forms. These colors represent our brand, and no one should be confused about that.</p>
				<p>The legacy of our Gen 1 products gave us a wide selection of colors, each specific to that product. While these are legacy products, and they and their colors won't be seen too much anymore, their colors are a part of our heritage and should be preserved.</p>

				<h1><a id='format' href='#format' title='Link to this section'>#</a>Format</h1>
				<h3>Document Formatting</h3>
				<p>In general, we want our official documents to feel professional, polished, and intentionally designed. We can do this by increasing the spacing of the lines in paragraphs, branding the document with our colors and logo, and expressing the contents in a clear and ordered manner. Making these small decisions and changes to a basic document are often enough to give the reader a feeling of a well-designed, perhaps expensive product.</p>

						<footer></footer>
					</div>
					<figcaption>Example document</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>If possible, place a 25px stripe of <em>Xtract Blue</em> in the header and footer of official documents.</p>
				<p>If possible, offset the Xtract Solutions logo to the right; otherwise, let it occupy its own space on the left (do not embed the logo inside of text).</p>
				
				<h3>Hierarchical Headers</h3>
				<p>Use a clear outline of different sized headers to organize your documents and long text sections.</p>
				<p>If using a numbered outline (1., 1.1., 1.1.1.), ensure that your headers are still sized appropriately. Do not indent child headers or their paragraphs.</p>
				
				<h3>Body Text</h3>
				<p>Justify your body text whenever it is feasible. This makes it more aesthetic and polished looking.</p>
				<p>Employ a font-size/line-height ratio of <strong>1:1.44</strong>. This spaces the paragraph lines apart which increases readability as well as giving the impression of space and intentional design.</p>
				<p>Whenever possible, limit body text width to 800px. The farther your eyes have to scan while reading, the more likely your reader will lose their place. This also gives more of an intentional design feel.</p>
				
				<h3>Emphasis</h3>
				<p>Use <strong>bold</strong> text to point out important things that the reader MUST see and remember. Doing this increases retention and recognition of the text, but using too much bold emphasis overwhelms the reader and the whole section gets lost.</p>
				<p>
					Text to be sure you embolden:
					<ol>
						<li><strong>The first sentence of a list item,</strong> if the list is a paragraph that can be easily summed up by its first sentence. This can also make long lists or lists with large amounts of text more readable</li>
						<li>Warnings and errors that the user has to do something about</li>
						<li>Headers</li>
						<li>Important info, like dates and times of meetings, or the specific wording that the use must see and agree to</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>Use <em>italics</em> to emphasize personal wording, introduce new concepts, and to give subtle corrections. Using too much italic emphasis makes you sound sarcastic or snippy.</p>
				<p>
					Other uses of italic emphasis include:
					<ul>
						<li>Setting apart the title of a book, movie, or other media</li>
						<li>Annotating web elements, buttons, menu items, etc
							<ul>
								<li>Click the <em>Send</em> button</li>
								<li>Open the menu and navigate to <em>File > Save As...</em> to save your file</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h3>Capitalization</h3>
				<p>Never capitalize email addresses.</p>
				<p>Unless the word is a proper noun, name, title, or internal jargon, words are only capitalized if they're at the beginning of a sentence.</p>
				<p>
					This includes:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Tech words:</strong> internet, website, online, email</li>
						<li><strong>Medical terminology:</strong> wheal, extract, treatment plan, provider</li>
					</ul>
					The only exception to this should be when talking to a client and using their terminology to communicate more effectively. If they capitalize <em>Provider</em>, for example, because that means something special to them, you should as well to avoid confusion.
				</p>
				<p>Use <em>title case</em> for headers and titles. This generally means you capitalize all words except for articles, prepositions, or coordinating conjunction (e.g. a, in, and, to) unless they begin the sentence.</p>
				<p>Do not write IN ALL CAPS in official documents or correspondance unless it's the only emphasis option available to you. No one likes getting yelled at. The only exception might be warnings the user must heed.</p>
				<h3>Punctuation</h3>
				<p>Use exclamation points only in casual correspondance, and even in that context, use them sparingly.</p>
				<blockquote>They’re like high-fives: A well-timed one is great, but too many can be annoying. - <em>Mailchimp Content Style Guide</em></blockquote>
				<p>
					Employ the <em>Oxford comma</em> in lists.
					<ul>
						<li>Let's get Zoë, Luke, and Addama in on this call</li>
						<li>We need to order pens, printer paper, and toner</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Do not use elipses (...) in official documents. In personal correspondance, use it sparingly, and only to indicate that you are trailing off on your thought and waiting for your reader to pick up where you left off. Do not use it for emphasis or to build "drama."</p>
				<p>Place a period at the end of every paragraph (or whatever punctuation belongs there).</p>
				<p>Do not end list items with periods, as the bullet point from the list acts as that period, essentially.</p>
				<p>Do not use ampersands unless it's a part of a proper name or convention.</p>
				<p>Do not use an apostrophe when pluralizing single letters or numbers. For example: 2000s, Ps and Qs.</p>

				<h3>Logo Use</h3>
				<p>Use only the highest quality, transparency-enabled logo available to you (above). This will allow you to resize the image without losing quality.</p>
				<p>Avoid having a black background behind the logo, as that does not fit our color scheme, nor was the logo made for that. If you must put the logo on a black or dark background, use the white transparent variant.</p>
				
				<h3>Logo Spacing</h3>
				<p>Always give the Xtract Solutions logo its own space. Never embed the logo inside of text, and never let it rest flush against an edge or border.</p>

				<h3>Company Voice</h3>
				<p>"Voice" is how we write and communicate, and includes the choices we make like which words to use, what tone to use, etc. As a company, all of our documents and correspondance should be written with the same voice. This presents a solid, unified face to the outside world that is predictable, professional, and polished.</p>
				<p>
					Xtract Solutions is:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Undeniably from Portland:</strong> casual, open-minded, sporty, and a little sarcastic (only a little!)</li>
						<li><strong>World-wise and accepting</strong> of the client's specific needs and processes. We've seen it all, so nothing is weird or surprising to us</li>
						<li><strong>Unafraid to be technical.</strong> We are working with professionals who know what they're doing and what they're talking about, and we don't need to beat around the bush when it comes to terminology</li>
						<li><strong>Genuine and personal, but concise and factual.</strong> Our clients are people, just like us, and we're not here to lawyer them, condescend to or patronize them, or keep a "professional distance." We are all in the same room, reading the same document, and working toward the same goal</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h3>Tone</h3>
				<p>
					Write positively, with active voice, and specific terms.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Bad:</strong> We can't start the project until everyone signs off on the requirements</li>
						<li><strong>Good:</strong> The project starts when everyone signs off on the requirements</li>
						<li><strong>Bad:</strong> The button is clicked by the Nurse, which opens the menu</li>
						<li><strong>Good:</strong> The nurse opens the menu by clicking the button</li>
						<li><strong>Bad:</strong> Can you get me the stuff we talked about today?</li>
						<li><strong>Good:</strong> If you can, please provide the requirements document and your signed contract by 5PM PST</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			
				<h1><a id='writing' href='#writing' title='Link to this section'>#</a>Writing</h1>
				
				<h3>Simple Writing Is Best</h3>
				<p>Do not use a big word when a small word will do. Being consistent, readable, and memorable is far more important than sounding smart, even if your audience speaks/writes that way. A big word now and then can help spice up your writing, but too many and you sound pompous or like you're over-compensating.</p>
				<p>Using common language and simple sentences increases retention and reduces the amount of nitpicking and other confusion your reader might give you. Remove any reason someone might have to not understand you.</p>
				<p>Even though we are a casual Portland company, do not use slang or colloquialisms that your audience won't understand in official documents and correspondance. Not only is that less than professional, you also run the risk of alienating or confusing your audience.</p>
				<p>
					Avoid the following writing faux pas:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>We're dynamically repurposing our orchestration metrics to double-down on end-to-end solutions and strategically drill-down into emerging e-business needs</strong>
							<ul>
								<li><em>What?</em> Lots of buzzwords, but nothing actually said. Everyone knows this is filler language, so don't use it</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Let's walk through how this is done</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>This is pandering, not helpful</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Wow ok, that's great thanks! Have a great weekend lol</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Far too casual, and using a friendly but unprofessional tone. You might think this lightens the mood or gets people to be comfortable with you, but in a business setting, it can be off-putting. Granted, you need to know your audience and how they will respond or expect you to speak with them and make decisions based on that</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>It's as easy as...</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Never simplify anything down like this. If a task was difficult for your audience to understand or do, you saying "it's easy!" makes them feel stupid</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>The devs're really looking forward to it</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Do not use unusual contractions. In general, stick with negation contractions ("n't"), and contractions of <em>are</em>, <em>will</em>, or <em>would</em> with pronouns ("You'll", "I'll", "We'd", "They'd"). Any other contraction will sound strange</li>
								<li>Similarly, do not use double contractions like "mightn't've." That looks ridiculous and you know it</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>I'll let the guys know once you ladies have made a decision</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Even if you are in fact speaking about/to a monogendered group of people, do not use gendered languge. In fact, try your hardest not to assume or declare gender at all, as in professional writing it shouldn't be necessary</li>
								<li>You will never go wrong with using "they" to refer to any number of people of any gender. Stick with that and you'll never run into issues</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h3>Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Definitions</h3>
				<p>If you use an acronym or initialism, spell out the entire phrase the first time you use it and attach the acronym to it. From then on, you can use the acronym without having to explain it. For example: "The base has a Network Operations Center (NOC). The NOC employs four people."</p>
				<p>If a word is specific to our industry, or would otherwise be confusing or conflicting to a person in another industry, include a short explanation after it. For example: "We use <em>React</em>, a Javascript framework that makes developing complex applications easier, to build Summit."</p>
				<p>Especially in important documents like contracts and agreements, always define your terms and phrases as exactly as you can without just stuffing the document with them. This can remove any doubt a person might have about what we're talking about, and also may remove potential holes in our wording that a nefarious agent might work out.</p>
				
				<h3>You Are The Company</h3>
				<p>Always refer to Xtract Solutions as "we", not "it."</p>
				<p>When writing, you represent the company. Xtract Solutions is not a separate entity that you are writing about. When we write or speak, our clients conflate us with the company. If you are unprofessional, the company is unprofessional.</p>
				<p>Similarly, as a company, we need to agree with ourselves. Never argue with other employees over email or other official correspondance. If the client can't trust what we say in an official capacity, how can they trust us to get our work done? Solve your problem offline and issue a matter-of-fact correction later.</p>
				
				<h3>Take the High Road</h3>
				<p>There is no occasion in which you should make jokes or comments at the expense of other companies, our employees, the people you correspond with, or your family. Some people use these kinds of comments as a way to lighten the mood or commiserate with who you're talking to; this usually just comes across as sleazy and unprofessional.</p>
				<p>Self-deprecation can be a great tool to lighten the mood, but use it sparingly. Do it too much and people will start to believe the things you say about yourself.</p>
				
				<h3>Metaphors and Similes</h3>
				<p>Use metaphors only when a topic might be confusing or foreign to your audience, or you need to appeal to them in a deeper way than simple writing can accomplish. Using them too often, or trying to theme an entire explanation or conversation around one long extended metaphor is likely to cause more confusion than to help.</p>
